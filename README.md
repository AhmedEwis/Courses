# Courses
For some of the courses I've taken either from school or MOOCs from Coursera there have been assignments, lab reports, projects, etc. I upload everything I've done, and people can use as a reference to compare or if people are interested about courses. I believe everyone is responsible for their own education, copying doesn't further your development in anyway and so longterm it'll do more damage than just struggling with the assignment. With that said sometimes the assignments can be unclear or you get stuck for too long, and then it could be useful.
